# Kickstarter Theater and Play Funding Analysis

An initial view into Kickstarter Theater and Play funding success.

### Module 1 Challenge Submission

**3 Key Takeaways**  
  * Kickstarters for Plays are generally less successful as the Goal increases  
  * May and June have seen the most Theater kickstarter launches, but have also seen the greatest success with 67% of May and 65% of June launches successfully reaching their goal  
  * December appears to have the highest risk of failure for Theater kickstarters with only 49% achieving success in hitting goal  


#### Play Outcomes by Goal

The above graph shows the success and failure rate of hitting goal for Kickstarter Plays based on goal size (no play projects in the sample were canceled).  There is a general downward trend for success rate as goal size increases.  Between 30,000-45,000 we see a departure from trend.  As goal size increases there are fewer projects in each bucket, so the success or failure of 1 or 2 projects has a much greater influence on the overall percentage of the bucket.  Most likely the higher success rates seen in the 35,000-39,999 and the 40,000-44,999 buckets have less to do with goal amount, and more to do with other attributes of the projects.  For example, further analysis into these buckets may reveal a higher percentage of known playwrights with a history of successful kickstarter projects at lower goal amounts in the past.

#### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

May and June are the busiest months for kickstarter theater project launches.  Although these months have seen the greatest number of project launches, which would suggest greater competition for pledges and a potential higher risk of failure, we are also seeing the highest success rates for projects launched in May and June.  Across the entire sample – 61% of theater kickstarters were successful in reaching their goal, with May and June having 67% and 65% success rates respectively.  December has the lowest number of projects being launched and also has the lowest success rate with only 49% of projects achieving goal.  As shown with the Plays category – goal size can have an influence on success rate.  This view into project launch month does not take into account the weighting of goal size in each month, which may skew the success rate for a particular month.  Limiting the analysis to the likely goal range may provide a better view of success rate by launch date.
